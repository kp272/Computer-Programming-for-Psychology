# This is my set of answers to Assignment 2:

### Print exercises
1) See file [yourname.py](https://github.com/kp272/Computer-Programming-for-Psychology/blob/main/Assignment2/yourname.py)
2) No varriable showed up in the editor

### Operation exercises
1) Python outputs the same values for these
2) The modulo operator tells us what is left over (remainder), after we divide two numbers. 
```
print(101 % 25)
1
```
3) The "**" operator does exponentiation, and the "//" operator does division, but rounds the answer down.
```
print(10 ** 2)
100
```
```
print(3 / 4)
0.75
```
```
print(3 // 4)
0
```
```
print(-3 / 4)
-0.75
```
```
print(-3 // 4)
-1
```
4) Python does follow order of operations
```
print(1 + 2 + 3 * 4 / 5)
5.4
```
```
print(1 + 2 + (3 * (4 / 5)))
5.4
```

### Variable exercises
1) See file [yourname.py](https://github.com/kp272/Computer-Programming-for-Psychology/blob/main/Assignment2/yourname.py)
2) Yes. The variables "letter1" to "letter5" show up, corresponding to their values, that are "K" to "I"

3)Python does not have a problem with two variables having the same value.
```
print(letter1)
K
```
```
print(letterX)
K
```
4) NA
5) Changing the value of "letterX" did not change the value of the other variables. 
6) Changing the value of "letter1" did not change the value of "letterX".
```
print(letter1)
K
```
```
print(letterX)
K
```
After changing the value of letter1 to "z"
```
print(letterX)
K
```
```
print(letter1)
z
```
