2) No varriable showed up in the editor

### Operation exercises
1) Python outputs the same values for these
2) The modulo operator tells us what is left over (remainder), after we divide two numbers. 
```
print(101 % 25)
1
```
3) The "**" operator does exponentiation, and the "//" operator does division, but rounds the answer down.
```
print(10 ** 2)
100
```
```
print(3 / 4)
0.75
```
```
print(3 // 4)
0
```
```
print(-3 / 4)
-0.75
```
```
print(-3 // 4)
-1
```
4) Python does follow order of operations
```
print(1 + 2 + 3 * 4 / 5)
5.4
```
```
print(1 + 2 + (3 * (4 / 5)))
5.4
```
