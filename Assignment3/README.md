Question 1) Both didn't work because the operation that worked has strings, and the operation that didn't work has an integer and a string. 
```
sub_code = "sub"
subnr_int = 2
subnr_str = "2"
```
```
print(sub_code + subnr_str)
        sub2
```
```
print(sub_code + subnr_int)
# code "print(sub_code + subnr_int)" didn't work
```
Question 2) 
```
print(sub_code + " " + subnr_str)
        sub 2
```
```
print(sub_code + " " + subnr_str*3) 
        sub 222
```
```
print((sub_code + subnr_str)*3)
        sub2sub2sub2

```
```
print((sub_code*3)+(subnr_str*3))
        subsubsub222

```

# List operations exercises
